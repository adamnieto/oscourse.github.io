Q: I log into root using "su -" and run the command "services-admin". 
   I get the following error.
	(services-admin:2198): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display;

A:
	Do the following:

	First log into root account. Add your regular user account to sudoers 
	list by editing the file /etc/sudoers. In this file, make a 
	copy of the line

	root ALL=(ALL) ALL

	and change "root" in the copied line to your regular userid. For example

	kartik ALL=(ALL) ALL

	Save the changes and log out of root.

	Now execute the following command as regular user:

	$ sudo services-admin

	When it asks for password, enter your regular user password
	(not root password). This gives you the permission to execute
	privileged commands from your normal user account,
	including X-windows based administration tools.
=============================================================================

Q: I still get the following error when executing "services-admin"
	(services-admin:2198): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display;

A: 
	Make sure you are logged in via the X-windows interface (GUI).
	services-admin requires GUI.

	If you are working in text console, you may need to manually 
	choose the services in /etc/rc.N directory, where N is 
	your runlevel.

	If you find another text-only tool to do this, let me know.

=========================================================================

Q: As for the services-admin, I can run it 
   successfully in X-window. However, there only shows 
   four services and many services you referred to in 
   the assignment do not come up. What's the problem?

A:
	Unfortunately, services-admin doesn't seem to be 
	up-to-date anymore. You may want to try one of 
	the suggestions in the link below:

	http://www.debianadmin.com/remove-unwanted-startup-files-or-services-in-debian.html

	You may also want to look for those extra 
	services in the /etc/rcN.d directory (N=runlevel). 
	Either add symbolic links to the missing services or 
	remove the ones you don't need. But don't remove 
	something that you are not sure whether it is required 
	or not.

	You can also do a bit of hit-and-trial. You may want to 
	make a backup of the original rcN.d directory (N being the 
	runlevel) and then try eliminating one symlink at a time. 
	An easier way might be to google the service name to find 
	out what it is. 

	Don't spend unreasonable amount of time on this 
	though. The purpose is to give you an idea of how 
	to configure a lean system.

=========================================================================

Q: As for configuring the kernel through running "make 
   menuconfig", how can I know the hardware configuration? 
   Just look into the system log files or ask TA?

A:
	You can look through the output of the commands "dmesg" 
	and "lspci" or through the file /var/log/syslog. These will typically 
	list the hardware components in the system. Also /proc 
	directory might give you some additional information. 

	Another approach is to start with a working configuration
	that includes almost everything and then incrementally 
	remove some components that you think you may not need and 
	see if it still boots up. Keep repeating till you have 
	a minimal working .config file. 

	Its easier to go from a working .config file to another 
	working .config file than from a non-working to working one.
	Its also a good idea to save a backup copy of a working 
	.config file before you make changes to it. This way you 
	can always come back to the working version in case your 
	changes don't work and you forget what changes you made.

=========================================================================

Q: I compiled and installed my kernel without making any code changes
   and it panics when I try to boot.

A:
	You are probably missing some necessary kernel drivers.
	Please compare your .config file with the original one in /boot directory
	...it should be named /boot/config<some old version number>. See 
	what's missing. You can use the "diff -c" command to compare
	the differences between the two config files.

	You can even try to load that original config file (/boot/config<some old version>)
	in your "make menuconfig" step (one of the last two options in 
	the menu) and compile your kernel using this original config file.

	Also make sure you recreate the initrd image file using
	mkinitramdisk, each time you recompile the kernel.

=========================================================================
Q: I recompiled and installed a new kernel and it panics. 
   How do I log into the system in order to fix what I broke?

A:
	At the "boot:" prompt, type (yourid).safe where (yourid)
	is the name of the regular kernel image. This will boot your
	system into a clean kernel image. However the file-system
	you see after booting into (yourid).safe will be the same
	as what you get with (yourid) image. Now you can fix 
	what you broke.

=========================================================================
Q: Can I get a sample config file that works as a starting point?

A:
	Yes, you can download a sample configuration file 
	for 2.6.29 kernel that worked for me:

	http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~kartik/cs350/sample_config 

	Use that, either as a starting point or as-is. However, note that 
	I use this configuration for a 2.6.29 kernel on
	my own virtual system and it may or 
	may not work for yours. It is also not optimized for a 
	small kernel size, so you should that part on your own.

	When you use this file, don't directly copy it into your 
	.config file. Rather do "make menuconfig", select 
	"Load and Alternate Configuration File", then type in 
	"sample_config" (assuming you've placed sample_config file 
	under your linux directory), then select "ok", and finally 
	select "exit", and click "Yes" when it asks to save the new 
	kernel configuration. Do the steps exactly as mentioned 
	above. Now compile your kernel and boot it. See if it works. 

=========================================================================
Q: I get the following error when I try to boot.

 ipconfig: eth0: SIOCGIFINDEX: No such device
 ipconfig: no devices to configure
 /init: .: line 174: can't open /tmp/net-eth0.conf
 kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!

A:
	Since the virtual systems in the lab boot over the network, 
	the kernel should have network driver available from 
	the very beginning.

	There are two different type of machines in the G-7 
	lab -- Dell 760 (newer machines) and Dell 745 
	(older machines). The type of the machine is given in a 
	small black label on the top of the machines' front side.

	Make sure the following network drivers are *statically* 
	compiled into your kernel (preceded by a * symbol) and not 
	configured as a module (preceded by a M)

		- On Dell 745, compile in Broadcom Tigon3 support
		- On Dell 760, compile in Intel(R) PRO/1000 PCI-Express Gigabit Ethernet support

	It is also recommended that you consistently use only 
	one type of machine to avoid changing having to change 
	your configuration when switching machine types.

===========================================================================
Q: Should I directly try to access xtime from my kernel module or  should I use the syscall that I implemented in PartB?

Ans:

Neither. Use current_kernel_time(...) which will read xtime atomically for you.

You cannot normally call system calls from kernel modules (unless special precautions are taken). They are for interaction with user space.
