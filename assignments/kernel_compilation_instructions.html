<H1>Configuring and compiling the Linux Kernel</H1>

<ol>

<li>
Now download a copy of kernel 4.4.1 source code 
<pre>
$ wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.4.1.tar.gz
</pre>

<li>
Extract the kernel source tree from the downloaded file. 
For example, if you downloaded the tar.xz file, then execute 
<pre>
$ tar xvf linux-4.4.1.tar.xz
</pre>

<li>
<b>Configure the kernel:</b>

<pre>
$ make menuconfig
</pre>

<p>
The kernel comes in a default configuration, determined by the people who put together the kernel source code distribution. It will include support for nearly everything, since it is intended for general use, and is huge. It will take a long time to compile and a long time to load. 

<p>
The "make menuconfig" step allows you to customize the kernel configuration. It will present you with a series of menus, from which you will choose the options you want to include. For most options you have three choices: (blank) leave it out; (M) compile it as a module, which will only be loaded if the feature is needed; (*) compile it monolithically into the kernel, so it will always be there from the time the kernel first loads.

<p>
There are couple of specific things you want to accomplish with your reconfiguration.
<ul>

	<li> Reduce the size of the kernel, by leaving out unnecessary components. This is helpful for kernel development. A small kernel will take less time to compile and less time to load. It will also leave more memory for you to use, resulting in less page swapping and faster compilations.

	<li> Retain the modules necessary to use the hardware installed on your system. 
	To do this without including just about everything conceivable, you need to know 
	what hardware is installed on your system. Use the commands <tt>lspci</tt>, <tt>dmesg</tt>, 
	or check the file <tt>/var/log/syslog</tt> to determine your computer's hardware configuration.
	You can also ask the TA or the instructor.
</ul>

<b> These two steps are highly recommended, but don't spend an unreasonable amount of time doing this. The more you can reduce the kernel size and module count, the more it will greatly speed up compile and boot time.</b>

<p>
Using common sense, select a reasonable set of options for your kernel.
You can also consult the help descriptions for a least all the top-level menu options, 
so that you become more familiar with the range of drivers and software components in the Linux kernel.

<p>
Before exiting the final menu level and saving the configuration, it is also a good idea to save it to 
a named file, using the "Save Configuration to an Alternate File" option. By saving different 
configurations under different names you can reload a configuration without going 
through all the menu options again.

<p>
You can also compare your .config file with the default one normally present in /boot directory.

<li><b>Compile the kernel:</b>

<pre>
$ make bzImage
</pre>

<p>
The command will compile the kernel and create a 
compressed binary image of the kernel. 
The kernel image can be found at arch/x86/boot/bzImage (for a x86 based processor). 

<li><b>Compile the kernel modules:</b>
<pre>
$ make modules
</pre>
This command will compile the dynamically loadable kernel modules 
you have selected in the configuration step. 
The result will be creation of .ko files for each module. 
For example, if you chose to compile the network device driver for the 
Realtek 8139 card as a module, the `driver/net/' directory will 
contain a file with the name 8139too.ko.

<p>
<li> <b>Install the compiled kernel and modules as root as follows:</b>

<pre>
$ sudo make modules_install
$ sudo make install
</pre>

<p>
The "make modules_install" and "make install" steps need to be done as root, 
since they write into system directories (/boot and /lib/modules). 
The kernel image (bzImage) is copied into /boot, and has a name starting 
with "vmlinuz" and including the version number. 
The modules go into a sub-directory of /lib/modules named after the version number.

<!--
<p>
<li>
<b>Create an initial RAM disk:</b>
<pre>
$ cd /boot
$ sudo mkinitramfs -o initrd.img-4.4.1 4.4.1
</pre>

The initial RAM disk is 
an archive of certain critical modules which need to be preloaded by the system at boot time, 
i.e. the system cannot wait to load these modules till after a complete boot up of the system.
At boot time, the kernel unpacks that archive into RAM disk (a block device stored in memory), 
mounts it and uses it as initial root file system.


<p>
Do the following two steps only once at the beginning when you start with kernel assignments 
OR later if you change the kernel versions you use. This creates symbolic links so that 
system scripts in the G-7 and Q-22 labs can pickup your kernel and RAM disk images.
<pre>
$ sudo rm initrd.img
$ sudo ln -s initrd.img-4.4.1 initrd.img
</pre>

IMPORTANT: Now check if you have the following two symbolic links are correctly set up in your /boot directory.
<pre>
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 2008-01-30 22:34 initrd.img -> initrd.img-4.4.1
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 2008-01-30 22:33 vmlinuz -> vmlinuz-4.4.1
</pre>
This last step is important for your image to boot correctly using network boot via the 
network boot system in the G-7 and Q-22 labs. There is a script at the network boot server 
which runs every few seconds, picks up your kernel image (vmlinuz) and ram disk image 
(initrd.img), and copies them to correct locations in the server so that next time 
you can boot off your new kernel image. So make sure that these two symbolic links 
point to the correct kernel image that you want to boot next time.

<p>
<li>
<b>Reboot the system into your new kernel.</b>
<pre>
$sudo reboot
</pre>

After your VM is on, check if your new kernel is loaded. 
<pre>
$ uname -a
</pre>
