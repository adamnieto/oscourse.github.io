<H1>Assignment:<BR>
Kernel Modules and Character Device to list all processes</H1>
</CENTER>

<OL>

<LI><P>
Implement a kernel module that
creates a <tt>/dev/process_list</tt> character device.
The character device should support the <tt>read()</tt> operation. 
When the <tt>read()</tt> system call is invoked on your character device from a user space process,
your kernel module should return to the followig information for 
all currently running processes:
<ol>
<li> process ID 
<li> parent process ID 
<li> the CPU on which the process is running
<li> its current state.
</ol>

For example, the output could be as follows:

<pre>
PID=1 PPID=0 CPU=4 STATE=TASK_RUNNING
PID=2 PPID=0 CPU=2 STATE=TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
PID=10 PPID=2 CPU=0 STATE=TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
PID=16434 PPID=16424 CPU=10 STATE=TASK_DEAD
PID=14820 PPID=16424 CPU=8 <font color=red>STATE=TASK_WAKEKILL,TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE</font>
...and so forth
</pre>

<font color=red>
<p>Updated instructions:

<p>Note that the "state" field in  <tt>task_struct</tt> can be -1, 0 or greater than 0.  A state value of 1 or more indicates a combination (bitwise OR) of values listed here: http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/sched.h#L207

<p> For example, <tt>TASK_WAKEKILL | TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE</tt>

<p>So you have to parse a positive state value to indicate which of the states listed above apply to a process. You can pass the raw state value (as a <tt>long</tt> value) from kernel to user space and decode the state values in your user space program.
</font>

</LI>

<LI>
Also, provide a user-space C program that open your  character device and outputs the list of processes retrieved from your character device.

<p>
One such application could be written as follows (please fill in the missing code):

<pre>
char *buffer;

/* allocate memory for character buffers HERE before you use them */

fd = open("/dev/process_list", O_RDONLY);
/* check for errors HERE */

while(!some termination condition)
{
	bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, buffer_length);
	/* check for errors HERE. Exit loop if all processes have been retrieved. */
	/* print the output you have read so far. */
}

close(fd);
</pre>

</LI>
</OL>

<!--
<H2>Part B: Character Device to list ready processes for each CPU</H2>
<P> Write another kernel module that creates a character device <tt>/dev/runq_list</tt> and its corresponding user space code
that retrieves the list of processes currently in the <b>ready queue of each CPU</b>. 
In your output, group processes by the CPU on which they are running.</LI>
-->


<P>BEWARE that bugs in kernel code may either crash your kernel immediately 
or may have no immediate
visible effect, but may have a delayed effect that is disastrous.
Therefore, you cannot assume that the thing
you did most recently is necessarily the cause of a crash.</P>

<H2>Grading Guidelines</H2>

<pre>
	Kernel Module- 60
	User-level code - 40
	Error checks and coding style - 20

	Total = 120
</pre>

<li> The function <a href=http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/sched.h#L3364><tt>task_cpu()</tt></a> can help you extract the currently assigned CPU for a process.

	Chapters 1 and 2 of the following online book provide a good introduction
	to the kernel, though with a bias towards device-driver development.
