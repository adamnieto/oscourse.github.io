<H1> Assignment 1 </H1>

<p>
<H2> Objective: </H2>
 This assignment is meant to refresh your skills in C programming, specifically recursion, malloc/free, pointers, and the use of a debugger.

<p>
<H2>Problem 1:</H2> 
Write a program to implement Recursive Fibonacci Sequence:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, and so on
</br>

<ul>
<li>
	Create three files
</br>	1. main.c - Takes argument, calls fib, prints result
</br>	2. fib.h - Contains recursive fib declaration
</br>	3. fib.c - Contains recursive fib implementation
</li>
</li>
	Example:
</br>	$ ./fib 10
</br>	Output: 55
</li>
</ul>

</br>
Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers generated by following function F(n):
</br>Fibonacci Definition: F(n) denotes Fibonacci function where n>0
</br>F(1) = 1
</br>F(2) = 1
</br>F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
</br>In simple terms, it is a function that generates nth Fibonacci number by adding up the two numbers before it.


<H2>Problem 2:</H2> 
Write a program to implement a FIFO queue data structure using a dynamic array of size N.
<ul>
<li> Create one file -  fifo.c - which takes an integer N as a command-line argument. N is the size of the FIFO queue.
<li> Provide an interface to insert and remove numbers from the FIFO queue.
<li> Initially the FIFO queue is supposed to be empty.

<li> Make sure you create a "dynamic array" of size N using malloc. Do not use a static array.
<li> Example:
</br>	$ ./fifo 4
</br>	$ 1. Insert
</br>	 &nbsp;&nbsp;   2.Remove
</br>	 &nbsp;&nbsp;    3.Exit
</br>	This will create a FIFO queue of size 4 i.e. it can store maximum 4 numbers at a time. It shows an    
	interface (any simple command line interface) that allows user to insert and remove 
	numbers from the FIFO queue. 
</ul>

<b>Related Concepts: </b>
</br> FIFO is a first-in-first-out data structure i.e. the item which was added the earliest is removed first.
</br>For example: lets say there is a FIFO queue of size 3 which is empty initially. So, the FIFO queue has a space for three numbers:
</br>___, ___, ____
</br>Note: first position is the head and the last position is the tail. A number is added to the FIFO queue from the tail and removed from the head.
</br>So, if we insert a number,say 12, in the FIFO queue then the queue will become
</br>12, ___, ____
</br>After inserting another number, say 47, the FIFO queue will be
</br>12, 47, ____
</br>Removing a number from the FIFO queue will remove the number from the head shifting remaining numbers towards the head, so it will become
</br>47, ___, ____





<p>
<H2> Submission Guideline:</H2>

<ul>

	<li> Use one makefile to compile both programs and create two executable "fib" and "queue" for Q1 and Q2 respectively.

	<li> Follow the remaining submission guidelines from the <a href=http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~kartik/cs350/#assignments>course web page</a>.

</ul>

<H2> Grading Guideline:</H2>
Total points: 100
<ul>
        <li> 10 - Use of Fibonacci function in the main.c file which is declared in fib.h and implemented in fib.c file.
        <li>  &nbsp; 5 - Use of command line argument to accept user's input for the value of n in Fibonacci sequence problem.
        <li> 20 - Implementation of recursive Fibonacci function. It should display the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
        <li> &nbsp;  5 - Use of command line argument to accept user's input for the value of n for queue size in problem 2.
        <li> 10 - Use of memory allocation function to create a dynamic array of size n in problem 2.
        <li> 10 - In problem 2, you should allow the user to add a new number to the queue and display the numbers in queue after insertion.
        <li> 10 - In problem 2, you should allow the user to remove a number from the queue and display the remaining numbers in queue.
        <li> 10 - Use of one makefile to compile both programs together.
        <li> 10 - Handle all major error conditions including error values returned by memory allocation functions.
        <li> 10 - Clean, modular, and commented code. Clean readable output. No "giant" functions. Minimal use of global variables.
</ul>
